# Test Stochasticity of ALE (Branch for Kevin)

### Requirements

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [atari-py](https://github.com/openai/atari-py)
* [Arcade-Learning-Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)

### Run the code

Hi, Kevin, please run ```python test_stochastic.py``` in this particular for_kevin branch. On other branches, the code has some other purposes which may cause confusion to you.

In the '''./action_sequence''' dir, their are random generated action sequence I am using to test the stochasticity in ALE, for you task, you may want to replace the random generated actions with actions generated from your agent.
Besides, the image gets bigger when you are using long action sequence, you may want to take care of that before it makes a mass on your machine.
